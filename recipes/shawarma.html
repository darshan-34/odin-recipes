        <h3> Shawarma Recipe </h3>
        <p> 
            <strong>Shawarma is a Middle Eastern dish that originated in the Levant during the Ottoman Empire</strong>, 
            consisting of meat that is cut into thin slices, stacked in an inverted cone, 
            and roasted on a slow-turning vertical spit. <strong><em>Traditionally made with lamb or mutton, 
            it may also be made with chicken, turkey meat, beef, falafel or veal.</em></strong> 
            The surface of the rotisserie meat is routinely shaved off once it cooks and is ready to be served. 
            Shawarma is a popular street food throughout the Arab world, Levant, and the Greater Middle East. 
            It has become a popular street food in India. This chicken shawarma is made with flavorful chicken 
            thighs marinated in a spiced yogurt. Slice the cooked chicken and serve in pita bread with tomato, 
            sliced onion, and my homemade tahini sauce for a popular Middle Eastern sandwich.
